# Rust Embedded Example

Use `cortex-core` as an embedded library directly in a Rust application — no server required.

## Setup

```bash
cargo run
```

## What It Does

- Opens a Cortex database at `./demo.redb`
- Stores several knowledge nodes
- Searches the graph
- Generates a briefing
- Prints results
